# Neural Network in C++

MLP Neural Networks today have applications in many different fields such as image processing, data analytics, circuit design, etc. Although all similar in theory, these neural nets all differ slightly due to their technical needs.

To accomodate for this heterogeneous state, this project aims to provide flexibility for the user to configure all I/O, layers, activation, etc best suited for their particular needs. The advantages of this, apart from its cutomizable nature, is that it provides high-level abstraction for its users. Never mind the complex works under the hood; the user just has to build the network and feed the necessary data to it.
